CSC 172 lab 4 has us implement a linked list using the URList interface and the URNode class. Unit tests were performed with example arrays that can directly be used to initialize a linked list. The print method implemented in the URLinkedList class was used to confirm the correctness of outputs. Each method was tested with both normal and abnormal inputs (ex: index values that are outside the bounds of the list).
